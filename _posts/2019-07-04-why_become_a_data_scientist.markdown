As a Risk Manager, I've been working with very large ralational data bases for many years. The daily need of reading data from a database often from multiple and different types of sources using SAS and/or SQL. Then building decision rules, using CHAID decision trees have been the tools of choice for my industry's business needs. About 5 years ago, the term "Data Scientist" stared poking up online and at conferences. Seems there is a lot of overlap to what I've been doing. Need to learn Python, some JAVA, Hadoop, HIVE, Spark, etc. Looking forward to learning the new tools and techinques and plan on utlizing in my current business role and maybe change my career path towards more Machine Learning vs. CHAID decision trees.
